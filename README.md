Homework 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

Description:
I have created an application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. This app runs in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code I wrote. 

Usage:
Click the button "Click Me to Get Started!"
Follow the prompts to select the parameters of your random password. If you select a number outside of 8-128, then you will be alerted to enter a different number within the correct range. If you do not select any character types, you will be directed to start over and choose at least one character type.
Once you have answered all prompts, click the "Generate Final Password Results" to see a randomly generated password created according to your selected criteria.
